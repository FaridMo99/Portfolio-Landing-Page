I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks like **React** and **Next.js**, and I'm currently expanding my skillset into **backend technologies** like **Node.js** and **PostgreSQL** to become a full-stack developer.

This repository contains the codebase for my **personal portfolio**, built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Below are two featured projects I've built and showcased in this portfolio.
