# Farid Mohseni | Developer Portfolio

Hi, I'm Farid Mohseni, a Fullstack Developer focused on developing scalable, type-safe, and high-performance web applications. My expertise lies in creating Applications that use React/Next.js at the frontend and robust Node.js/Express backends. I build systems with a strong emphasis on data integrity, security, and automated CI/CD workflows.

My experince ranges from designing robust REST APIs and real-time communication with WebSockets to automating the Workflow with GitHub Actions and bundling the application with Docker.

This repository contains the codebase for my personal portfolio, built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
